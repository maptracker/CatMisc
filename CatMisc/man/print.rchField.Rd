\description{
S3 print class for annotated RefClassHelper fields
}
\details{
If a RefClassHelper object has annotated its fields with
descriptive metadata (via the $annotateFields() method, which is
generally automatically called by the $help() method), the fields
will be classed to allow this function to run. It just makes the
description and help guidance a little nicer
